# ConnectWith

We want people to make the best use of their first degree connections on LinkedIn to achieve things in life. Often times, we have amazing ideas that go to waste because we weren't able to find enough people to help carry out the idea and we don't know where to look. It is surprising how much you can learn from a person's LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn's search feature digs through a user's whole profile and searches for keywords all throughout. We found this to be useful for the following example scenarios: 

- A community director wants to organize a rather big dance class, but she is not sure of how she could get multiple volunteers to help. Using our tool, she can quickly search through her LinkedIn connections and use our templates to send them messages. The more messages sent, the more likely someone is going to respond.
- A person is interested in building a startup, and want to talk to as many potential partners as possible.
- A fresh grad is desparate in looking for jobs, and have to send many personal messages and e-mails to recruiters. 
- etc.

Due to LinkedIn APIs not being readily available for non-exclusive users, we decided to use Puppeteer to automate most of the process.
